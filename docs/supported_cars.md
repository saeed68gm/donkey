## Tamaya TT-01

![donkey](./assets/build_hardware/TT01.PNG)

The TT-01 is a new build that we expect to be a higher end version of the Donkey.  For first time builders we recommend the Magnet.  That said, it has some pros and cons that people should be aware of:
Pros:
* Better kinematics and traction on smooth surfaces - basically this means it will handle Better
* Larger build area for adding other sensors.  
* Globally available with several clones.

Cons:
* Usually comes as a kit - you will need to supply your own ESC, battery, servo, pinion gear and motor.
* Needs to run on a smooth surface like a driveway or parking lot.   
* Larger size requires a larger 3D printer to print chassis, otherwise purchase at the Donkeystore.
* More expensive

In addition to the standard donkey parts, Raspberry Pi etc, you will need to buy the following components.
